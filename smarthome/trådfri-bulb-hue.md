Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC4tBIoEZ3U&t=19s

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Hue Essentials app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superthomaslab.hueessentials&hl=en). 

## Caveats

1. The Tr책dfri bulbs have to have at least firmware 1.2.x or later. If you bought your Tr책dfri bulb in 2019 or later it will most likely have updated firmware. You only need the Tr책dfri bridge if you need to update the bulbs firmware.
2. The lights have to be very close to the Hue bridge to connect. After they are connected they don't have to be close.

## Steps

1. Factory reset bulb by flashing the light on and off six times. The light will give off a small flash to show that it has been reset.
2. Leave light on.
3. Hue Essentials -> Devices -> Add light -> Select your bridge.
4. Turn light off and then on again.
5. Keep the bridge and light very close to eachother.
6. Press Touchlink in Hue Essentials.
7. Wait for bulb to flash.
8. Press Search for lights in Hue Essentials.
9. Light will now connect and show up in Hue Essentials.
