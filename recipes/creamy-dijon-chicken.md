# Creamy dijon chicken

## Ingredients

### For the chicken
* 1 kg chicken breasts
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 150g bacon

### For the sauce
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp fresh parsley
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 80 ml white wine
* 400 ml heavy cream
* 2 tbsp dijon mustard
* 1 chicken stock cube
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 60 g parmesan
* 500g spinach

## Method

1. Season chicken with seasoning salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken until crispy and cooked through (about 8 minutes each side, depending on thickness). Transfer to a plate; set aside.
3. To the same pan or skillet, add the bacon and fry until crispy. Transfer to plate, set aside. Drain some of the bacon fat, leaving about 2 tablespoons.
4. Heat butter in the pan and sauté onion until transparent. Sauté garlic, parsley, thyme and rosemary for about 1 minute until fragrant.
5. Add in the white wine to deglaze the pan while scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan; simmer for 3-4 minutes or until wine has reduced by half.
6. Pour in cream and Dijon, mix through and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and cook gently for a further minute to allow the sauce to thicken.
7. Add the Parmesan and allow to melt through the sauce. Season with bullion powder and pepper, to taste.
8. Add the spinach and allow to wilt. Return chicken to the skillet. Top with the crispy bacon. Sprinkle with extra herbs if desired. Serve immediately.
