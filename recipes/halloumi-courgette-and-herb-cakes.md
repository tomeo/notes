# Halloumi, courgette and herb cakes

Serves 4.

## Ingredients
* 2 carrots, peeled and grated
* 1 courgette, grated
* 500g halloumi cheese, grated
* 2–4 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
* 2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves
* 2 tbsp chopped mint leaves
* 2 free-range eggs, lightly beaten
* 2–4 tbsp breadcrumbs
* Olive oil, for frying
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

### For the chilli dressing
* 1 red chilli, finely sliced on the diagonal
* 2 cm piece of fresh root ginger, peeled and finely diced
* 2 tsp caster sugar
* 2–3 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 2–3 tbsp olive oil
* Pinch of salt

## Method

1. To make the halloumi cakes put the carrots and courgette in a sieve or colander and sprinkle with a decent pinch of salt to draw out the moisture. Place over a bowl to drain for 5 minutes, then tip into a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the excess water.
2. Put the halloumi, carrot mixture, spring onions, coriander and mint into a bowl, season and mix together. Add the beaten eggs and mix well, then stir in 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs. The mixture should be sticky enough to form into patties, if it’s not sticky enough add some more breadcrumbs. Shape the mixture into 8 larger patties about 1cm thick, or 16 smaller ones. To help shape the patties place a large spoonful of the mix onto a spoon and press against your hand and squeeze out any excess liquid. Leave in the fridge uncovered for at least 20–25 minutes to firm up.
3. Meanwhile, put all the dressing ingredients into a bowl and stir well until the sugar has dissolved. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.
4. Once you’re ready to cook, heat a large heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add a dash of oil and fry the halloumi cakes (in batches if necessary) until dark golden and crisp on either side and hot all the way through.
5. Serve the cakes hot with spoonfuls of the chilli dressing over the top.
